Over the course of 20 years, ecommerce evolved from a novel new concept into a major part of the worldâ€™s economy.
Ecommerce sales have continued to grow steadily, with the total sales increasing 185% from 2011 to 2018.

I'll be working with a dataset that contains  12,330 sessions belonging to different online shoppers, the features contained in the dataset includes Google Analytics for a website such as Bounce Rates, Page Value, Exit Rates etc.

I'll be using this features to build a model that will predict if the user purchases an item or not on the site considering the google analytics features earlier stated & other relevant features on the dataset

I'll use a Classifier Model to train the model because of the target column is a categorical feature.

In this project, I'll:

1. Prepare the data for machine learning

2. Train a model using a Classifier model

3. Measure the accuracy of the model
